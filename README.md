# Sales Ranking System

A console-based C++ program for a retail store, built for the **Algorithms and Complexities** course. It demonstrates two classic algorithms, **Linear Search** and **Merge Sort**, applied to a real-world marketing task: ranking products by how many units they have sold.

---

## 1. Project Overview

Retail stores need to know which products are selling well and which are not, so they can make marketing and stocking decisions. This program lets a user manage a list of products, record sales, search for products, and rank them by total units sold.

The program is menu-driven and runs entirely in the console (no GUI). It uses object-oriented programming and only the C++ standard library.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Practice object-oriented programming in C++ (a `Product` class stored in a `std::vector`).
- Implement and explain **Linear Search** for finding products.
- Implement and explain **Merge Sort** for ranking products by units sold.
- Analyze the **time complexity** (Big-O) of every major operation.
- Write clean, modular, well-commented, beginner-friendly code with input validation.

---

## 3. Features (Menu Options)

1. **Add a Product** - enter ID, name, category, and price.
2. **Display All Products** - show every product in a table.
3. **Record a Sale** - increase the units sold of a product.
4. **Search Product by ID or Name** - find products quickly.
5. **Sort Products by Units Sold** - rank highest to lowest (Merge Sort).
6. **Display Top 5 Best-Selling Products**.
7. **Display Lowest-Selling Products**.
8. **Save Products to File** - type a filename to save the current list (Save As). Press Enter with no filename to save to the default `products.csv`. Supports keeping several data files.
9. **Exit** - auto-saves the current data to `products.csv`.

---

## 4. Data Model

Each product is an object of the `Product` class:

| Field       | Type          | Meaning                        |
|-------------|---------------|--------------------------------|
| `id`        | `int`         | Unique product ID              |
| `name`      | `std::string` | Product name                   |
| `category`  | `std::string` | Product category               |
| `price`     | `double`      | Selling price                  |
| `unitsSold` | `int`         | Total units sold (for ranking) |

All products are stored in a `std::vector<Product>`, which grows automatically as products are added.

---

## 4a. File Storage (CSV Input/Output)

Instead of relying only on hard-coded data, the program reads and writes product data using **CSV** (comma-separated values) files.

**Format** - one product per line, fields in this order:

```
id,name,category,price,unitsSold
```

**Example `products.csv`:**

```
101,Wireless Mouse,Electronics,19.99,120
102,Coffee Mug,Kitchen,8.5,45
103,Notebook,Stationery,3.25,200
104,Bluetooth Speaker,Electronics,45,75
105,Water Bottle,Sports,12.75,30
```

**How loading/saving works:**

- **On startup**, the program automatically loads the default file `products.csv`. If it exists, that data is used; if not, built-in sample data is loaded so the program is never empty.
- **On exit** (option 9), the current data is auto-saved back to `products.csv`.
- **Save Products to File** (option 8) lets you type any filename, so you can keep **multiple data files** (e.g. `products_2024.csv`, `products_2025.csv`). If you press Enter without typing a name, it saves to the default `products.csv`.

**Limitation (beginner-friendly simplification):** because a comma separates the fields, product names and categories should **not contain commas**. Any malformed line is skipped with a warning instead of crashing the program.

## 5. Algorithms Used

### Linear Search (for searching)
Linear Search checks each product one by one until it finds a match.

**Why chosen:**
- The product list is **not kept sorted** by ID or name, so a faster method like binary search cannot be used directly.
- It is **simple and always correct**, regardless of how the data is ordered.
- It works for both exact ID matches and partial name matches.

**Time complexity:** `O(n)` - in the worst case, every product is checked.

### Merge Sort (for ranking)
Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm: it splits the list in half, sorts each half recursively, then merges the two sorted halves back together (in descending order of units sold).

**Why chosen:**
- It **guarantees `O(n log n)`** in the best, average, and worst cases, unlike Quick Sort, which can drop to `O(n^2)` in the worst case.
- It is **stable**: products with equal sales keep their original relative order.
- It is a clear, classic teaching example of divide-and-conquer.

**Time complexity:** `O(n log n)` time, `O(n)` extra space (for the temporary merge buffers).

## 6. Time Complexity Analysis (Big-O)

Let `n` be the number of products.

| Operation                     | Time Complexity | Notes                                           |
|-------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Add a Product                 | `O(n)`          | Scans to reject duplicate IDs; `push_back` is `O(1)` amortized |
| Display All Products          | `O(n)`          | Visits each product once                        |
| Record a Sale                 | `O(n)`          | Linear Search to find the product first         |
| Search by ID                  | `O(n)`          | Linear Search                                   |
| Search by Name                | `O(n)`          | Linear Search over all products                 |
| Sort by Units Sold            | `O(n log n)`    | Merge Sort                                       |
| Top 5 Best-Selling            | `O(n log n)`    | Sorts a copy, then reads the top 5              |
| Lowest-Selling                | `O(n log n)`    | Sorts a copy, then reads the bottom 5           |
| Save to File (option 8)       | `O(n)`          | Writes each product as one CSV line             |
| Load from File (on startup)   | `O(n)`          | Reads and parses each CSV line once             |

## 7. How to Build and Run

Requires a C++ compiler that supports C++17 (for example, `g++`).

```bash
# Compile
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -o sales_ranking main.cpp

# Run
./sales_ranking
```

On the first run there is no `products.csv`, so the program pre-loads a few sample products. When you exit, your data is saved to `products.csv` and will be auto-loaded next time.

---

## 8. Sample Input and Output

Below is a short sample session (using the pre-loaded sample products).

**Displaying all products (menu option 2):**

```
--- All Products ---

```

**Auto-load on the next run and auto-save on exit (option 9):**

```

## 9. Possible Future Improvements

- **Binary Search** on an ID-sorted copy for faster lookups on very large datasets.
- **Quoted CSV fields** so names and categories can safely contain commas.
- **Sort by other fields** (price, category, name), ascending or descending.
- **Sales reports** such as total revenue per category (`price * unitsSold`).
- **Edit or delete products** from the list.
- **Undo a sale** in case of mistakes.
